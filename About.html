            <h1>Who I am</h1>
            <ul>
                <p>I'm Clement, a 23 year old developer from Nairobi. However, I'm currently living and working in Eldoret
                after becoming inseparable with the city where I studied my degree in Software Engineering.

                I'm obsessed with technology solutions and my blog certainly shows it. I blog about what I develop, what
                I want to invent and what inspires me. I'm a big fan of neutral tones, minimal styles and clean lines. I
                also talk about my travels: cities/countries I've visited and my top picks to get the most out of each
                place. Not to mention the best places to grab amazing vegan food.

                I'm only really just getting started with my software development company, but I hope you enjoy it. Feel
                free to get in touch with me regarding collaborations, questions, or even for a chat!</p>
